The previous AI engineer's primary goal was to transform a failing dynamic React/FastAPI/MongoDB application into a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript website, ensuring pixel-perfect design fidelity based on user feedback. The work involved extensive UI/UX adjustments across multiple pages. Initially, the focus was on converting Speisekarte, Standorte, and Bewertungen pages, which were deemed satisfactory. However, Über uns and Kontakt pages underwent repeated overhauls due to user dissatisfaction with their professional look. The AI engineer iteratively refined these pages, addressing issues like external image blocking ( resolved by local image storage), font inconsistencies, and navigation alignment. The process evolved from merely mirroring existing satisfactory pages (Standorte template) to creating entirely new, super-professional and geil designs, involving parallax effects, animated elements, and detailed content structures. The Bewertungen page was also extensively refined to display authentic Google reviews with correct statistics. The trajectory concludes with the AI engineer preparing to remove a specific section from the Bewertungen page based on the user's latest instruction.

The initial problem was a non-functional React/FastAPI/MongoDB application suffering from a MySQL error, requiring conversion into a purely static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript website. Key requirements included: INI-based menu configuration, 1:1 design replication, live preview via , and comprehensive documentation. Subsequent iterations focused on achieving pixel-perfect UI for Speisekarte, Standorte, and Bewertungen. Critically, Über uns and Kontakt pages required multiple design overhauls to achieve a professional and geil aesthetic, evolving from mirroring existing pages to custom, engaging layouts. This included a specific request for Kontakt to feature a central form (Bild 1). Finally, the Bewertungen page needed to display *only* authentic Google reviews, removing reservation options and incorporating correct statistics (e.g., 4.7 stars, 287 reviews) from the provided real data. The user consistently emphasized modern, professional, and visually appealing designs with strict adherence to specified colors and fonts.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was finalizing the Bewertungen page based on comprehensive user feedback. The page statistics have been corrected to reflect real Google data: 4.7 stars, 287 reviews, and 95% recommendation rate. The AI engineer has successfully integrated specific, authentic Google reviews from Jimmy's Tapas Bar into the page, including reviewer names, original texts, and realistic timeframes, replacing generic content. The Reservierung section was previously removed. The current work specifically focuses on addressing the user's latest explicit request: to remove the Besondere Erfahrungen section from the Bewertungen page entirely and to ensure only the real Google reviews provided are present. The AI engineer acknowledged this request in the last message of the trajectory.

<optional_next_step>
Remove the Besondere Erfahrungen section from  and verify the integrity of the remaining authentic Google reviews.
