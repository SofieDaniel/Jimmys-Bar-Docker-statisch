The previous AI engineer's primary task was to transform a failing dynamic React/FastAPI/MongoDB application into a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript website, ensuring 1:1 design fidelity based on user-provided visual references. The work progressed through an iterative feedback loop, with the user frequently providing specific design corrections. Initial efforts focused on diagnosing the original backend issue and then building the static core with INI-based menu configuration.

Key challenges involved achieving pixel-perfect UI replication, debugging frontend loading issues (e.g.,  due to external image URLs, loading screen not hiding), and adapting to user's evolving aesthetic preferences (e.g., changing orange borders to white, refining professional page layouts). While Speisekarte and Standorte pages were eventually deemed satisfactory, the Über uns and Kontakt pages underwent multiple complete overhauls due to user dissatisfaction, culminating in a decision to mirror the successful Standorte and Bewertungen page structures for Über uns. The trajectory concludes with the AI engineer attempting this structural copy for Über uns.

<product_requirements>
The initial problem was a non-functional full-stack application (Jimmy's Tapas Bar) with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB, suffering from a MySQL connection error. The explicit requirement was to convert this into a purely static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript website. Key requirements included:
1.  **Purely Static Architecture**: No backend frameworks or databases.
2.  **INI-based Menu Configuration**: Menu data defined in , loaded dynamically via JavaScript.
3.  **Exact Design Preservation**: Maintain original HTML structure, CSS values, and visual appearance (1:1 replication).
4.  **Live Preview**: An  file loading locally via  with immediate updates.
5.  **Comprehensive Documentation**:  with instructions.
6.  **Quality Standards**: ES6+ JavaScript, clear structure, consistent naming, no visual changes without user request.
7.  **Iterative Design Fidelity**: Subsequent requests focused on pixel-perfect replication for Speisekarte, Standorte, Bewertungen, Über uns, and Kontakt, often involving corrections based on screenshots (e.g., no images for menu items, prominent allergen displays, correct category button colors, large modern cards for locations, professional styling for reviews, and consistent white borders across all pages). The user has continuously emphasized professional aesthetics and consistent design language.

<code_architecture>
The application, originally a React/FastAPI/MongoDB setup, was refactored into a purely static site. The old dynamic application directories were removed, and the static site was moved to the root  directory.

    -   **Importance**: Global and main styling for the entire website.
    -   **Changes Made**: Extensively modified to match user's design requests, including general layout, responsiveness, and changing orange borders/accents to white across the site. Also adjusted for navigation and footer consistency.

    -   **Importance**: Specific CSS rules for the Über uns page ().
    -   **Changes Made**: Created initially, then underwent multiple complete rewrites to attempt various professional designs, including one mirroring user-provided Bild 1, and finally to mimic the structure and styling of  and .
-   **/app/css/kontakt.css**:
    -   **Importance**: Specific CSS rules for the Kontakt page ().
    -   **Changes Made**: Created alongside  to professionalize form elements and contact info boxes with white borders. Its state is implicitly affected by  rebuilds.
-   **/app/js/main.js**:
    -   **Importance**: General JavaScript functionalities like cookie banner, scroll-to-top, and mobile navigation, but crucially, also loading screen handling and configuration path.
    -   **Changes Made**: Modified to correctly resolve  path for different page depths and to properly hide the loading screen.
-   **/app/js/speisekarte.js**:
    -   **Importance**: Handles dynamic loading/rendering of menu items from , category filtering, and item detail display.
    -   **Changes Made**: Heavily modified to adapt to 1:1 design feedback, including list presentation, side-by-side detail panel, allergen display, and mouseover functionality.

<pending_tasks>
The user's primary pending task is the completion of the Über uns page to their satisfaction, specifically to achieve the desired professional look consistent with Standorte and Bewertungen. Once Über uns is complete, the Kontakt page will need similar professional overhaul and design consistency.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was deeply engaged in a recurring issue: the user's dissatisfaction with the Über uns page design, despite multiple previous attempts to professionalize it. The user explicitly stated, mann es geht immer noch nicht !!! bitte vollständig prüfen und reperieren, and indicated that the page should look like Standorte and Bewertungen.

The AI engineer's current approach is a complete structural overhaul of the Über uns page. The last actions taken were:
1.  Inspecting  (Chat 342) to understand its exact structure and design.
2.  Committing to copying this *exact* structure to  (Chat 343).
3.  Committing to copying the exact CSS structure of the Standorte page to  (Chat 345), which is the last action observed in the trajectory.

The aim is to achieve pixel-perfect consistency for Über uns with the Standorte and Bewertungen pages, which were previously deemed satisfactory by the user. The current work is a direct response to the user's repeated insistence on design fidelity for the Über uns page.
