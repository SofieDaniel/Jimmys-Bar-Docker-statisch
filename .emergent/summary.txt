The AI engineer was tasked with converting a failing full-stack React/FastAPI/MongoDB application (Jimmy's Tapas Bar) into a purely static HTML/CSS/JavaScript website with INI-based menu configuration. The initial challenge involved diagnosing the original backend's MySQL connection failure. Upon user instruction, the AI then built a static version, focusing on replicating the existing UI. However, the user repeatedly emphasized a 1:1 design fidelity requirement, providing iterative feedback and images, which led to significant redesigns of the Speisekarte, Standorte, and other pages. The AI has been working in an iterative feedback loop, constantly adjusting the static site's design to match the user's evolving and more precise original design expectations. The work is currently focused on achieving pixel-perfect replication for specific pages, starting with Standorte.

The primary problem initially was a non-functional full-stack application (Jimmy's Tapas Bar) with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB, suffering from a backend MySQL connection error. The user's explicit request was to transform this into a purely static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript website. Key requirements included:
1.  **Purely Static Architecture**: No backend frameworks or databases.
2.  **INI-based Menu Configuration**: All menu categories, items, and prices defined in a  file, loaded dynamically via JavaScript.
3.  **Exact Design Preservation**: Maintain original HTML structure, CSS values (colors, margins, fonts), and visual appearance.
4.  **Live Preview**: An  file that loads locally via  with immediate updates.
5.  **Comprehensive Documentation**: A  with installation, deployment,  editing instructions, and local preview URL/port.
6.  **Quality Standards**: ES6+ JavaScript, clear structure, consistent file naming, no visual changes.
7.  **Iterative Design Fidelity**: Subsequent requests focused on achieving a 1:1 pixel-perfect replication of the original dynamic site's design for individual pages (Speisekarte, Standorte, Bewertungen, Über uns, Kontakt), often correcting previous attempts based on user-provided screenshots. Specific design nuances included no images for menu items, prominent allergen displays, correct category button colors, and detailed layout for locations and reviews.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Static Site Generation**: Transforming a dynamic application into pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
-   **INI File Parsing**: Loading and interpreting data from  configuration files using JavaScript for dynamic content rendering.
-   **Frontend Development**: HTML5, CSS3 (including advanced Tailwind-like patterns implicitly used for styling), ES6+ JavaScript.
-   **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the website adapts correctly to various screen sizes.
-   **Supervisor**: Tool for managing and controlling long-running processes (e.g., stopping old frontend/backend services).

<code_architecture>
The original application had a  (FastAPI, intended MySQL/MongoDB) and  (React) structure. The AI engineer transformed this into a new, purely static site within , which was later moved directly to  and the old dynamic app directories (, , , ) were removed.

**Current Directory Structure (after removal of old app and moving static site to root):**


-   **/app/config/menu.ini**:
    -   **Importance**: This file serves as the single source of truth for all menu data (categories, dishes, prices, descriptions, allergens). It's crucial for the dynamic rendering of the menu page without a database.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initial creation with example menu items. Repeatedly updated throughout the conversation to reflect changes in menu structure (e.g., adding allergens) and ensure data validity.
-   **/app/css/styles.css**:
    -   **Importance**: Contains global and main styling for the entire static website.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created by copying styles from the original React app. Extensively modified multiple times to match specific user-requested design elements, including category button colors, general layout, and responsiveness.
-   **/app/css/speisekarte.css**:
    -   **Importance**: Specific CSS rules for the menu page ().
    -   **Changes Made**: Created to hold menu-specific styles. Modified to remove image displays, style allergen warnings, and adjust the side-by-side layout for dishes and details. Also updated to correct category button colors.
-   **/app/css/standorte.css**:
    -   **Importance**: Specific CSS rules for the locations page ().
    -   **Changes Made**: Initially created to add basic styling for the locations page. Later modified significantly to implement the large modern cards with background images layout as per the user's latest specific design requirement.
-   **/app/css/bewertungen.css**:
    -   **Importance**: Specific CSS rules for the reviews page ().
    -   **Changes Made**: Created to implement the Google Reviews integration design, structured info cards, and original blue Google button styling.
-   **/app/js/main.js**:
    -   **Importance**: Contains general JavaScript functionalities like cookie banner handling, scroll-to-top, and mobile navigation.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initial creation for basic static site functionality. No specific major design-related changes noted, mainly structural.
-   **/app/js/speisekarte.js**:
    -   **Importance**: Handles the dynamic loading and rendering of menu items from , category filtering, and item detail display on hover/click.
    -   **Changes Made**: Created to parse  and render the menu. Heavily modified to adapt to the user's 1:1 design feedback, including changing menu item presentation from cards to a list, implementing the side-by-side detail panel, removing image rendering, displaying allergens, and fixing the mouseover functionality.
-   **/app/index.html**:
    -   **Importance**: The main entry point for the static website.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initially created as a static version of the original app's homepage. Modified to link to the new static CSS and JS files and to ensure the overall HTML structure matched the original design requirements.
-   **/app/pages/*.html**:
    -   **Importance**: These are the individual static content pages (Speisekarte, Standorte, Bewertungen, Über uns, Kontakt, Impressum, Datenschutz).
    -   **Changes Made**: Initially created with minimal content. Subsequently, , ,  underwent multiple significant overhauls to achieve the precise 1:1 design requested by the user, including structural changes to accommodate new layouts and content. The other pages (, , , ) were created later in the process and were yet to be fully transformed to the original design.
-   **/app/deploy.sh**:
    -   **Importance**: A helper script for simple local deployment using .
    -   **Changes Made**: Created to streamline the static site's local testing and deployment.
-   **/app/README.md & /app/README_STATIC.md**:
    -   **Importance**: Documentation for the static website.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initial  created with usage instructions. A final  was later generated to summarize the completed static site.

<pending_tasks>
The previous AI engineer was explicitly instructed to replicate the original design for several pages in a specific order:
-   **Speisekarte** (Menu) - After Standorte, as it was fixed once but user was still not satisfied.
-   **Bewertungen** (Reviews)
-   **Über uns** (About Us)
-   **Kontakt** (Contact)
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer was deeply involved in addressing the user's persistent demand for 1:1 design replication, specifically for the Standorte (Locations) page. The user had explicitly expressed dissatisfaction with previous attempts, stating the current design was wrong and provided a new visual reference (Bild 2) showing large modern cards with pictures as the desired outcome.

The AI engineer acknowledged this precise feedback, understood the discrepancy between the current small boxes and the desired large cards, and committed to building the Standorte page exactly like Bild 2. The last actions taken were:
1.  Acknowledging the new visual requirement (Chat 273).
2.  Modifying  (Chat 274), which contained the HTML structure for the locations page.
    
3.  Proceeding to adjust the CSS in Chat 275, specifically for , to implement the styling for the large modern cards layout. This edit was initiated but the output of the tool call is not shown, meaning the work on the CSS for the Standorte page was mid-process when the trajectory ended.

The Standorte page is currently being redesigned to match the specific large modern cards with background images style as per the user's latest provided image.

<optional_next_step>
Replicate the Speisekarte (Menu) page design to match the user's explicit 1:1 original design requirement, as it is the next page in the user's prioritized list.
