The previous AI engineer's core task was to transform a non-functional React/FastAPI/MongoDB application into a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript website, replicating a pixel-perfect design. This involved extensive UI/UX refinement across all pages. Initial success with Speisekarte, Standorte, and Bewertungen was followed by iterative overhauls of Über uns and Kontakt due to demanding design requirements (professional, geil). Key challenges included resolving external image loading errors by localizing assets and ensuring consistent, modern aesthetics. The engineer successfully integrated authentic Google reviews, refined page layouts, standardized hero sections, and meticulously updated the entire menu via an INI file. The work was highly iterative, responding to minute user feedback on visuals, content, and functionality. The trajectory concludes with the engineer diagnosing an issue with menu category display, indicating a problem in the JavaScript responsible for rendering menu items after the large  update.

The primary objective was to refactor a broken dynamic React/FastAPI/MongoDB application into a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript website. Key requirements included: INI-based menu configuration, pixel-perfect 1:1 design replication, and live preview.
Specific page overhauls were crucial:
1.  **Bewertungen**: Display only authentic Google reviews, remove reservation options, and incorporate precise Google statistics (4.7 stars, 287 reviews). Filter buttons were later requested to be removed.
2.  **Über uns**: Achieve a super-professional and geil look, evolving into a STORYTELLING DESIGN with parallax, values cards (images), and a timeline. Specific content removal (Valencia education, Jimmy's picture) and layout adjustments (values side-by-side) were requested.
3.  **Kontakt**: Initially mirrored Standorte, then reverted to a central contact form (Bild 1), and finally re-designed for a FULL-SERVICE DESIGN with professional form and call-to-action buttons. Image selection was highly iterative, requiring specific Spanish-themed visuals, and hero text refinement was ongoing.
4.  **Speisekarte**: Full update with extensive, authentic Spanish menu items, including descriptions, allergens, and prices from a provided list. Category positioning issues needed fixing.
5.  **Global UI**: Ensure consistent, modern, and visually appealing designs, with strict adherence to specified colors and fonts. Footer content was streamlined (location info removed, layout adjusted). Google Maps integration for location routing was also implemented.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was in the process of verifying the complete and comprehensive update of the  file and its corresponding display on the  page. The user had provided the full, detailed menu, including various categories of starters, salads, main dishes (vegetarian, chicken, meat, fish), sides, desserts, and an extensive list of beverages (water, soft drinks, juices, homemade lemonades, wines, beers, spirits, cocktails). The AI engineer meticulously updated the  file in multiple steps due to its large size, ensuring all items, descriptions, allergens, and prices were correctly transferred. The engineer then confirmed that all 31 categories were populated with products.

However, in the very last interaction, after the user requested a final verification (sicher ? prüfen !!!!), the AI engineer identified a new problem: Die Kategorien werden noch nicht richtig angezeigt. This indicates that while the  file itself is complete and correct, the JavaScript on  responsible for dynamically displaying these categories and their items is not functioning as expected. The engineer's last thought explicitly mentions checking the JavaScript and manually testing the menu, pinpointing the current state as a diagnostic phase for this display issue. The frontend services are running (confirmed by a successful screenshot attempt, though the display itself is problematic).
