The AI engineer's trajectory for Jimmys Tapas Bar" highlights an intensive, iterative development cycle focused on stabilizing and enhancing a full-stack application. A persistent challenge was aligning the database to MySQL, despite recurrent MongoDB issues and user demands for MySQL compatibility for webspace deployment. The engineer demonstrated strong debugging skills, addressing critical issues like CMS login failures (due to incorrect frontend URL and missing backend endpoint), inconsistent API responses, and incomplete menu data. Key progress includes implementing MouseOver functionality for menu items, fixing various CMS content management flows, and dynamically updating pages like "About Us" and "Locations". Recent efforts meticulously addressed numerous user feedback points, including correcting business information (addresses, phone numbers, opening hours, email), refining website content (removing "Newsletter", "Follow Us", adjusting homepage specialties), and replacing imagery. The development was characterized by continuous adjustment to explicit user demands, often uncovering cascading issues requiring precise backend and frontend modifications. The project is currently focused on ensuring all menu items are correctly imported and displayed with full details.

The core objective for "Jimmys Tapas Bar application is to transform an initial MVP (v7) into a fully functional and dynamically manageable system suitable for standard webspace deployment, strictly requiring MySQL. Initial issues included non-functional core pages, a broken backend database, and missing functionalities like newsletter subscriptions. A comprehensive menu overhaul was critical, demanding over 269 new food and drink items with detailed information (prices, descriptions, allergens, origin, preparation). An interactive MouseOver feature for menu details was also required, along with an intuitive Admin CMS Panel for all content (menu, About Us, Locations, Navigation, Footer, Buttons). Specific fixes included removing text from the contact page and resolving Invalid Date issues for newsletter data. All content must be dynamic and not hardcoded, with an ultimate goal of full functionality and dynamic content for deployment.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in a series of comprehensive updates based on direct user feedback:

1.  **Menu Content & Database**: The user explicitly stated the menu was not current and provided a list of over 207 items. Previously, only 124 items were imported into MySQL, and then 137 items. The AI created and iterated on  and  scripts to import the full menu, addressing database connection issues and schema discrepancies ( column). The user then highlighted the missing detailed descriptions for dishes.
2.  **Contact & Location Information**: The user provided definitive correct addresses, phone numbers, email, and opening hours for both Neustadt and Großenbrode locations (Neustadt: 015735256793, Großenbrode: 015782226373, Email: info@jimmys-tapasbar.de). The AI updated this information across the backend API, frontend , , , , and  components. Opening hours were later refined to be a consistent 12:00 - 22:00 Uhr for both locations.
3.  **Content Refinement**:
    *   **Footer**: Newsletter subscription section and Folgen Sie uns (Follow Us) social links were definitively removed from .
    *   **Locations Page**: Redesigned for aesthetics, integrated Google Maps for route planning, removed Tisch reservieren buttons, and updated the header image to a Spanish theme.
    *   **Contact Page**: Simplified to include only a functional contact form, removing location details. A backend endpoint for the contact form was also added.
    *   **Impressum & Datenschutz**: Both pages were made static and updated with the correct business information and contact details.
    *   **Homepage Specialties**: The number of displayed specialties was fixed to show 4 instead of 3, by correcting the frontend logic in . The homepage hero image was also updated to a Spanish-themed one.
    *   **About Us content**: A specific introductory text (Wir laden Sie herzlich ein...) was implemented, replacing a previous version that explicitly mentioned the owner, as per user request.

The immediate state is that core contact information, location details, general content, and navigation elements have been extensively revised and appear to be largely correct and dynamic where intended. The critical remaining task revolves around the complete and accurate import of all menu items with their detailed descriptions.
