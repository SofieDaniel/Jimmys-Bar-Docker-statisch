# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "Completed comprehensive testing of the extended CMS backend for Jimmy's Tapas Bar Admin System. All new endpoints are working correctly except for one minor issue with unauthorized access handling. Successfully tested: 1) Authentication with admin credentials and JWT token validation, 2) Content management for retrieving and updating page content, 3) Menu management for retrieving and creating menu items, 4) Review management for creating and retrieving pending reviews, 5) Contact message handling for sending and retrieving messages, 6) Maintenance mode activation and status checking, and 7) User management for creating and retrieving users. The only issue found is that protected endpoints return 403 Forbidden instead of 401 Unauthorized when accessed without authentication, which is a minor issue as the endpoints are still properly protected."

    message: "Attempted to test the Admin CMS system but encountered issues accessing the admin page. The admin route is defined correctly in the App.js file, but when navigating to /admin, the main site is displayed instead. The login form is not being rendered. Tried restarting the frontend service and directly accessing the admin page via curl, but the issue persists. The backend API endpoints for authentication are accessible and return the expected responses. This appears to be an issue with the React Router configuration or client-side routing. Further investigation is needed to resolve this issue."

    message: "Completed comprehensive testing of the new CMS endpoints for Jimmy's Tapas Bar. Successfully tested all the following endpoints: 1) GET and PUT /api/cms/homepage for managing homepage content, 2) GET and PUT /api/cms/website-texts/{section} for managing navigation, footer, buttons, and general texts, 3) GET and PUT /api/cms/locations for managing location information with opening hours, and 4) GET and PUT /api/cms/about for managing about page content with team members and values. Fixed issues with the website-texts PUT endpoints that were causing 500 Internal Server Error due to duplicate parameters. All CMS endpoints are now working correctly with proper authentication and data validation."

    message: "Attempted to fix the Admin CMS implementation issue by modifying the React Router configuration in App.js. Tried changing the route from '/admin' to '/admin/*', adding a basename to BrowserRouter, and restarting the frontend service, but the issue persists. When navigating to /admin, the main site is still displayed instead of the admin login page. This appears to be a deeper issue with the React Router v7 configuration or how the routes are being processed. The backend API endpoints for authentication are working correctly, but the frontend routing to the admin page is not working. This is a critical issue that needs to be fixed before we can test the rest of the admin functionality."

    message: "Completed comprehensive testing of the Admin CMS implementation with the new pathname-based routing solution. The admin panel now loads correctly when navigating directly to /admin. Login with admin/jimmy2024 credentials works properly and displays the dashboard. Successfully tested navigation between all admin sections including Dashboard, Homepage editor, Locations, About Us, Menu, Reviews, Contact Messages, and Users. All sections load correctly, though the Hero section content in the Homepage editor wasn't found during testing (likely a content loading issue rather than a routing problem). Logout functionality works correctly, and the normal website pages continue to function as expected. Browser back/forward navigation between admin and main site also works properly. The pathname-based routing approach has successfully resolved the previous React Router issues."

    message: "Completed comprehensive testing of the MySQL migration for Jimmy's Tapas Bar CMS system. Found several issues that need to be addressed: 1) The backup system endpoints have issues with JSON serialization, particularly with the full backup endpoint which fails with an error about json.dumps() taking incorrect arguments, 2) The CMS endpoints (homepage, locations, about) are missing required fields in their responses after the migration, suggesting data structure changes or retrieval issues, 3) The system info endpoint is missing the MySQL section. On the positive side, the authentication, menu management, review management, contact message handling, and user management endpoints are all working correctly after the migration. The legal pages endpoints are also working correctly. These issues need to be fixed before the system can be considered fully migrated to MySQL."

    message: "Completed testing of Jimmy's Tapas Bar admin panel frontend to identify specific issues after MySQL migration. Found the following critical issues: 1) Content Management Issues: The homepage editor and general content sections are likely empty because the frontend components expect data in MongoDB format but the backend is now returning data in MySQL format. The components use optional chaining (e.g., content.hero?.title) which suggests they're designed to handle missing data. 2) Location Management Error: Confirmed the 'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')' error is likely occurring because locationsData.locations is undefined after MySQL migration. 3) Database Configuration: The SystemBackupSection component still shows MongoDB references instead of MySQL in the UI. 4) Newsletter Duplication: Confirmed duplicate newsletter signup forms on the main website - one in the content area (Home.js) and one in the footer (Footer.js). The admin panel routing appears to be working correctly as the login page loads, but there may be issues with the login functionality itself."

    message: "Completed code review of the MySQL compatibility fixes for Jimmy's Tapas Bar frontend. The following fixes have been properly implemented: 1) LocationsAdminSection.js: Added proper null checks with (locationsData.locations || []), updated data loading to handle MySQL response format with data.locations_data || data.locations || [], and fixed the save function to send data in the correct MySQL format. 2) AdminSections.js: Implemented data transformation to convert MySQL format to frontend format and back, with proper handling for features, specialties, and delivery sections. 3) Home.js: Removed the newsletter section from the homepage component, leaving only the footer newsletter form. 4) SystemBackupSection.js: Updated text references from 'JSON-Backup' to 'MySQL-Dump' and changed descriptions to reflect MySQL instead of MongoDB. While I was unable to verify these fixes through UI testing due to issues with the Playwright scripts, the code review confirms that all the required changes have been implemented correctly."

    message: "Completed comprehensive validation testing of the MySQL migration for Jimmy's Tapas Bar CMS system. The authentication, menu management, review management, contact message handling, and user management endpoints are all working correctly with MySQL. The system info endpoint now includes MySQL information showing the database name as 'jimmys_tapas_bar' with 17 tables. However, there are still issues with the backup system endpoints and CMS endpoints. The backup list endpoint returns a dictionary instead of a list, and both database and full backup endpoints have issues with JSON serialization. The CMS endpoints (homepage, locations, about) are missing required fields in their responses, suggesting that the data structure transformation between MySQL and the frontend is not working correctly. These issues need to be fixed before the system can be considered fully migrated to MySQL."
